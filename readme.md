The Vagrantfile comes from: https://github.com/fideloper/Vaprobash. I just enabled the Apache web server. This is set up just to start working with some php files, not Laravel. 

1. vagrant up
2. browse to http://192.168.33.10.xip.io/ OR http://192.168.33.10.xip.io/public if this is a Laravel project

For a Laravel specific setup, visit https://github.com/skaterdav85/vagrant-laravel-env
